The12thPlan was the product of a 24-hour hackathon called "HowdyHack" at Texas A&M created by Alline Ayala, Avery Reagan, and myself that won us the "Best Aggie Hack". It is/was a web application that rips calandar and map data from Texas A&M's wbesite and then displays it in a more user-friendly way. We also had a feature where you can click on a locaiton of the event and you would fly there on the map. We used so many tools including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, JSON, and even googles location API.
